Generates simple simulated demographies using marriage rules and kinship systems.

Allows specification of probability distributions for marriage, reproduction and mortality rates, as well as selecting from kinship systems (Eskimo and Hawaiian implemented) and marriage rules. Outputs plots of population pyramids, proportion of eligible marriage partners, lifetime fertility etc are produced. Currently no (genetic) relatedness outputs are produced.
